## Usage

<!---Link to the public part of the PRD, or to the related product discussion for experimental features-->

TBD

## TODO

<!---If necessary, create a list with technical/product steps-->

### Are you modifying a database?

- [ ] If not, add the `no db change` label to your PR, and you're good to merge.
- [ ] If yes, add the `db change` label to your PR. You'll receive a message explaining you what to do.

### Reminders when adding features

- [ ] Write unit tests using insta
- [ ] Write declarative integration tests in [workloads/tests](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/tree/main/workloads/test). Specify the routes to call and then call `cargo xtask test workloads/tests/YOUR_TEST.json --update-responses` so that responses are automatically filled.

### Reminders when modifying the API

- [ ] Update the openAPI file with utoipa:
  - [ ] If a new module has been introduced, create a new structure deriving [the OpenAPI proc-macro](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/derive.OpenApi.html) and nest it in the main [openAPI structure](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/blob/f2185438eed60fa32d25b15480c5ee064f6fba4a/crates/meilisearch/src/routes/mod.rs#L64-L78).
  - [ ] If a new route has been introduced, add the [path decorator](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/attr.path.html) to it and add the route at the top of the file in its openAPI structure.
  - [ ] If a structure which is deserialized or serialized in the API has been introduced or modified, it must derive the [`schema`](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/macro.schema.html) or the [`IntoParams`](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/derive.IntoParams.html) proc-macro.
        If it's a **new** structure you must also add it to the big list of structures [in the main `OpenApi` structure](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/blob/f2185438eed60fa32d25b15480c5ee064f6fba4a/crates/meilisearch/src/routes/mod.rs#L88).
  - [ ] Once everything is done, start Meilisearch with the swagger flag: `cargo run --features swagger`, open `http://localhost:7700/scalar` on your browser, and ensure everything works as expected.

### Reminders when modifying the Setting API

<!--- Special steps to remind when adding a new index setting -->

- [ ] Ensure the new setting route is at least tested by the [`test_setting_routes` macro](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/blob/5204c0b60b384cbc79621b6b2176fca086069e8e/meilisearch/tests/settings/get_settings.rs#L276)
- [ ] Ensure Analytics are fully implemented
  - [ ] `/settings/my-new-setting` configurated in the [`make_setting_routes` macro](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/blob/5204c0b60b384cbc79621b6b2176fca086069e8e/meilisearch/src/routes/indexes/settings.rs#L141-L165)
  - [ ] global `/settings` route configurated in the [`update_all` function](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/blob/5204c0b60b384cbc79621b6b2176fca086069e8e/meilisearch/src/routes/indexes/settings.rs#L655-L751)
- [ ] Ensure the dump serializing is consistent with the `/settings` route serializing, e.g., enums case can be different (`camelCase` in route and `PascalCase` in the dump)

#### Special cases when adding a setting for an experimental feature

- [ ] ⚠️ API stability: The setting does not appear on the main settings route when the feature has never been enabled (e.g. mark it `Unset` when returned from the index in this situation. See [an example](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/blob/7a89abd2a025606a42f8b219e539117eb2eb029f/meilisearch-types/src/settings.rs#L608))
- [ ] The setting cannot be set when the feature is disabled, either by the main settings route or the subroute (see [`validate_settings` function](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/blob/7a89abd2a025606a42f8b219e539117eb2eb029f/meilisearch/src/routes/indexes/settings.rs#L811))
- [ ] If possible, the setting is reset when the feature is disabled (hard if it requires reindexing)
