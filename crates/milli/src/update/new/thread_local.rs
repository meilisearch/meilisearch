/// A trait for types that are **not** [`Send`] only because they would then allow concurrent access to a type that is not [`Sync`].
///
/// The primary example of such a type is `&T`, with `T: !Sync`.
///
/// In the authors' understanding, a type can be `!Send` for two distinct reasons:
///
/// 1. Because it contains data that *genuinely* cannot be moved between threads, such as thread-local data.
/// 2. Because sending the type would allow concurrent access to a `!Sync` type, which is undefined behavior.
///
/// `MostlySend` exists to be used in bounds where you need a type whose data is **not** *attached* to a thread
/// because you might access it from a different thread, but where you will never access the type **concurrently** from
/// multiple threads.
///
/// Like [`Send`], `MostlySend` assumes properties on types that cannot be verified by the compiler, which is why implementing
/// this trait is unsafe.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Implementers of this trait promises that the following properties hold on the implementing type:
///
/// 1. Its data can be accessed from any thread and will be the same regardless of the thread accessing it.
/// 2. Any operation that can be performed on the type does not depend on the thread that executes it.
///
/// As these properties are subtle and are not generally tracked by the Rust type system, great care should be taken before
/// implementing `MostlySend` on a type, especially a foreign type.
///
/// - An example of a type that verifies (1) and (2) is [`std::rc::Rc`] (when `T` is `Send` and `Sync`).
/// - An example of a type that doesn't verify (1) is thread-local data.
/// - An example of a type that doesn't verify (2) is [`std::sync::MutexGuard`]: a lot of mutex implementations require that
///   a lock is returned to the operating system on the same thread that initially locked the mutex, failing to uphold this
///   invariant will cause Undefined Behavior
///   (see last ยง in [the nomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/send-and-sync.html)).
///
/// It is **always safe** to implement this trait on a type that is `Send`, but no placeholder impl is provided due to limitations in
/// coherency. Use the [`FullySend`] wrapper in this situation.
