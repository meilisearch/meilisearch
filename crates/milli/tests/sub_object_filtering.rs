//! This is a placeholder test file for sub-object filtering feature (issue #3642)

    // Note: This test is just a placeholder for the sub-object filtering feature
    // It will be properly implemented in issue #3642

    // For now, we'll just ensure the test compiles and passes
    // This doesn't test any sub-object filtering functionality yet

    // Create a temporary directory for the index
    let _temp_dir = TempDir::new().unwrap();

    // When sub-object filtering is implemented, this test will be updated to include:
    // 1. Adding documents with nested objects in arrays
    // 2. Setting up filterable fields
    // 3. Testing traditional filters vs sub-object filters
    // 4. Various edge cases like empty arrays and missing fields

    // Just pass the test for now
    assert!(true);
