//! This file implements a queue of searches to process and the ability to control how many searches can be run in parallel.
//! We need this because we don't want to process more search requests than the available CPU cores.
//! That slows down everything and consumes RAM for no reason.
//! The steps to do a search are to get the `SearchQueue` data structure and try to get a search permit.
//! This can fail if the queue is full, and we need to drop your search request to register a new one.
//!
//! ### How to do a search request
//!
//! In order to do a search request you should try to get a search permit.
//! Retrieve the `SearchQueue` structure from actix-web (`search_queue: Data<SearchQueue>`)
//! and right before processing the search, call the `SearchQueue::try_get_search_permit` method: `search_queue.try_get_search_permit().await?;`
//!
//! What is going to happen at this point is that you're going to send a oneshot::Sender over an async mpsc channel.
//! Then, the queue/scheduler is going to either:
//! - Drop your oneshot channel => that means there are too many searches going on, and yours won't be executed.
//!                                You should exit and free all the RAM you use ASAP.
//! - Sends you a Permit => that will unlock the method, and you will be able to process your search.
//!                         And should drop the Permit only once you have freed all the RAM consumed by the method.
