// ConfChangeV2 messages initiate configuration changes. They support both the

//
// The supplied context is treated as an opaque payload and can be used to
// attach an action on the state machine to the application of the config change
// proposal. Note that contrary to Joint Consensus as outlined in the Raft
// paper[1], configuration changes become active when they are *applied* to the
// state machine (not when they are appended to the log).
//
// The simple protocol can be used whenever only a single change is made.
//
// Non-simple changes require the use of Joint Consensus, for which two
// configuration changes are run. The first configuration change specifies the
// desired changes and transitions the Raft group into the joint configuration,
// in which quorum requires a majority of both the pre-changes and post-changes
// configuration. Joint Consensus avoids entering fragile intermediate
// configurations that could compromise survivability. For example, without the
// use of Joint Consensus and running across three availability zones with a
// replication factor of three, it is not possible to replace a voter without
// entering an intermediate configuration that does not survive the outage of
// one availability zone.
//
// The provided ConfChangeTransition specifies how (and whether) Joint Consensus
// is used, and assigns the task of leaving the joint configuration either to
// Raft or the application. Leaving the joint configuration is accomplished by
// proposing a ConfChangeV2 with only and optionally the Context field
// populated.
